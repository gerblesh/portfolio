      <p>Froggo Mode was created by me and Noah Adrichem for the BigMode game jam, hosted by BigMode, a video game publishing company owned by the Youtuber VideoGameDunkey. The theme for the game jam was the word "mode," so we took the idea of having a little frog character transform into a bullet and an anvil in order to complete each level. In Froggo Mode, each "mode" or character contributes a necessary role for completing the levels. For instance, the anvil mode can crush the trash blocks in each level. Noah and I had some challenges communicating as our timezones were polar opposites. We learned to work collaboratively and finished the game before the jam ended. Players gave extremely positive feedback. We are now working on a full release to publish on Steam!</p>

        <blockquote>
          The Universal Blue project builds a diverse set of continuously delivered operating system images using Fedora Atomic Desktop's support for bootable OCI containers. That's nerdspeak for the ultimate Linux client: the reliability of a Chromebook, but with the flexibility and power of a traditional Linux desktop. These images represent whatâ€™s possible when a community focuses on sharing best practices via automation and collaboration. One common language between dev and ops, and it's finally come to the desktop. We also provide tools for users to build their own image using our templates and processes, which can be used to ship custom configurations to all of your machines, or finally make the Linux distribution you've long wished for, but never had the tools to create.
        </blockquote>
          I maintain the Universal Blue Updater which is used as the automatic updater in several different desktop uBlue Images: Bazzite, Bluefin, Aurora. I often collaborate and triage bugs with members of the organization, file github issues, and pull requests to projects within and adjecent to the Universal Blue Github organization
